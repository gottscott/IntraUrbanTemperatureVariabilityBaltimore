# IntraUrbanTemperatureVariabilityBaltimore An analysis of intra-urban temperature variability in Baltimore. Part of Scott et 2016.  
This analysis is run in the iPython notebook analysetemperature.ipynb . It can also be run with the Python script of the same name (not tested). 

The notebook pulls in data listed in the data/ directory and relies on two python files for plotting utilities, ibuttonplots.py and spatialfunctions.py. 

Plots are saved in the plots/ folder of the same name (not tested). 

The notebook pulls in data listed in the data/ directory and relies on two python files for plotting utilities, ibuttonplots.py and spatialfunctions.py. Data is saved on my work machine as well as in my ~/git/ directory on Blaustein (blaustein.eps.jhu.edu). If you are not me and are reading this, data is available on request at ascott47@jhu.edu . 

Plots are saved in the plots/ folder.
